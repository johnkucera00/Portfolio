## Computer Science Projects

### [Multi-threaded Traffic Simulation GUI](./Multi-threadedTrafficSimulationGUI) (Java) (CMSC 335 Object-oriented and Concurrent Programming)

This program creates a traffic simulation GUI, using Java. We begin with 3-5 traffic lights and 3-5 cars which are all threads. The cars travel in a straight line at random speeds, their positions get updated live via the GUI and animation. The cars will start and stop according to the traffic lights, which are yellow (slow down), green (go), and red (stop).

### [Python Flask - Login Validation Form Webpage](./LoginValidationWebpage) (Python/HTML) (SDEV 300 Building Secure Python Applications)

### [Parser & GUI Generator Application](./Parser&GUIGenerator) (Java) (CMSC 330 Advanced Programming Languages)
