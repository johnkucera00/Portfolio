## Computer Science Projects

### [Multi-threaded Traffic Simulation GUI](./Multi-threadedTrafficSimulationGUI) (Java)
#### CMSC 335 Object-oriented and Concurrent Programming

Written in Java, this program uses multithreading to create a traffic simulation GUI and animation. Up to 5 cars travel in a straight line at random speeds and their positions are represented as (x,y) coordinates and animated in the GUI. The cars will move between 3-5 traffic lights, and they will start and stop according to the lights: green/yellow (go) and red (stop).

### [Login Validation Form Webpage](./LoginValidationWebpage) (Python/HTML)
#### SDEV 300 Building Secure Python Applications

This program uses Python Flask with HTML to create a log in webpage that prompts the user for username and password before granting access. Client is allowed 15 attempts to log in, after which throttling will occur to block the IP address for a period of time before allowing for retries. Exception handling and maintenance of a database of user information/IP addresses are utilized to process user inputs.

### [Parser & GUI Generator Application](./Parser&GUIGenerator) (Java)
#### CMSC 330 Advanced Programming Languages

Written in Java, this program uses recursive descent to parse a GUI definition language defined in an input file.  During parsing, the program ensures that the input language is properly formatted via a Lexical Analyzer.  After parsing, the program will generate the appropriate GUI defined by the input language.

## Technical Papers

### [Vulnerability Memo for Security Devices](./VulnerabilityMemo.pdf)
#### CMIT 320 Network Security

I wrote a Vulnerability Memo on two IoT devices: a smart door lock and a smart security camera. I researched the devices by using the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list and NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD). These resources provided information about the devices that helped me identify the devices’ vulnerabilities (which involved their uses of insecure network protocols) and possible solutions to fix them.

### [PC Build Manual](./PCBuildManual.pdf) 
#### CMIT 202 Fundamentals of Computer Troubleshooting

Wrote an in-depth manual to building a PC from scratch. It covers steps for installing essential hardware such as motherboard, CPU, RAM, power supply, hard drive, and peripherals. It also reviews BIOS settings that are necessary to configure. Additionally, it guides the reader on how to install Windows and configure important settings such as Windows Backup and Windows Firewall. Visuals are included with each step. I have built 5 PCs using this manual.

### [Evolution of System Performance](./SystemPerformance-ResearchPaper.pdf) (Research)
#### CMIS 310 Computer Systems and Architecture

I wrote a research paper analyzing how evolution of computer technology has improved system performance. I researched RISC and studied similarities and differences among its implementations over the past two decades. I also underlined the impact that pipelining, cache memory, and virtual memory had on system performance improvement when implemented with RISC.
